# Kyara Beverages - Responsive Homepage Project

## Overview

This project is a responsive, static homepage designed for **Kyara Beverages**, a brand focused on millet-based fruit drinks. The website aligns with Kyara’s brand values: **freshness**, **authenticity**, and a **user-centric** approach.

The homepage has been built as part of the internship selection process for the **Web Developer (Internship)** position and demonstrates skills in front-end web development and basic code structuring principles.

## 🔧 Features

- **Hero Section**: Includes the Kyara logo, tagline ("Refreshment, Reimagined"), and a full-width background image.
- **About Section**: Brief description about Kyara Beverages and its mission.
- **Product Teasers**: Three product cards with image placeholders, names, and short one-line descriptions.
- **Contact Form**: Simple form with `Name`, `Email`, and `Message` fields. The form is static and does not process submissions.

## 💡 Tools and Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – for semantic structure.
- **CSS3** – for responsive styling, animations, and layout.
- **Vanilla JavaScript** – used for toggling the mobile menu.
- **Google Fonts** – for custom typography.
- **Media Queries** – to ensure responsive design for screen widths from mobile (≤480px) to desktop (≥1024px).

I chose **plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** without any heavy frameworks to keep the site lightweight and easy to maintain. This also ensures full control over styling and responsiveness as per the design requirements.
